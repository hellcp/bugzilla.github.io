# How to Contribute

There are lots of ways to contribute to the Bugzilla project:

*   **Code**: You can [contribute to the Bugzilla codebase](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Developers) if you are familiar with Perl or features Bugzilla has/wants, such as DB, WebServices, etc. See also: [Developer's Guide](/docs/developer.html)
*   **Web Development and User Interface Design**: [contribute to the Bugzilla UI](/docs/developer.html) if you are a designer and/or are good at HTML and/or CSS.
*   **Documentation**: You can [contribute to the Bugzilla Documentation](http://bugzilla.readthedocs.org/en/latest/style.html) if you are familiar with Bugzilla as an administrator or as a user, or good at English.
*   **Release Process**: You can [help with the release process](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Release_Process) if you have some time to give us.
*   **QA**: You can [help with the QA process](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:QA) if you are familiar with Bugzilla as an administrator or as a user, and have some time.
*   **Support**: Bugzilla is community-supported. If you're an old hand at using or administering Bugzilla, hang out in our [support venues](/support/) such as our support mailing list or IRC channel and help other users.
