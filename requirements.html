<h1>Requirements</h1>

<h2>Operating System</h2>

<p>To install and run Bugzilla on your server, the core requirement is to have
Perl installed. This means that Bugzilla can be installed on any platform where
Perl can be installed, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Linux is highly
recommended and is our 1st-class citizen operating system.</p>

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>The hardware requirements depend heavily on the size of the user base and on
the number of bugs in your database. For small teams (up to a few tens of users)
with few bugs (up to a few thousands bugs), any good machine will do the job
pretty well. The important part is to have enough RAM (4 GB or more recommended)
and a fast processor (for instance, 3 GHz). Such hardware is pretty common
nowadays. A harddisk with 50 GB of free space is large enough.</p>

<p>Larger teams with several thousands of users and several hundreds of thousands
bugs need more hardware. To give you an idea, the Bugzilla installation at
Mozilla uses 8 servers: 3 webheads (12 GB of RAM each), 1 master database (35 GB
of RAM), 3 slave databases (35 GB of RAM each), and 1 email relay. Moreover,
mod_perl is enabled for improved performance. Note that it is designed for very
high concurrent access, which is quite unusual, so your requirements are probably
lower than that.</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>Bugzilla needs a database server, a web server, and Perl. In all
recommendations below, "Bugzilla requires version X" must be understood as
"Bugzilla requires version X <em>or newer</em>". In all cases, the newer, the
better, as newer releases have more bug fixes, are still supported and still get
security fixes. If you install the mimimum version mentioned below, the risk is
that this version will reach End Of Life pretty soon and so can be unsupported
at any time.

<dl>
  <dt>Perl:</dt>
  <dd>Bugzilla 4.4 and older require Perl 5.8.1, but Bugzilla 5.0 and newer
  require Perl 5.10.1. However, if possible you should install
  Perl 5.12 or newer, as these newer versions have some useful
  improvements which will make your life easier.</dd>

  <dt>Database Server:</dt>
  <dd>Bugzilla supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and SQLite. We highly recommend
  MySQL and PostgreSQL, which have the best support from Bugzilla and are used
  daily by Bugzilla developers. Oracle has
  <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=prod%3ABugzilla%20summary%3AOracle">several known issues</a>
  and is a 2nd-class citizen. It should work decently in most cases, but may
  fail miserably in some cases too. SQLite is recommended for testing purposes
  only or for small teams.<br>
  If you install MySQL, version 5.0.15 is required by Bugzilla 4.x, but we highly
  recommend version 5.5 or newer. If you install PostgreSQL, version 8.3 is required.</dd>

  <dt>Web Server:</dt>
  <dd>Bugzilla has no minimum requirements for its web server. We recommend to
  install Apache 2.2, though Bugzilla works fine with IIS too (IIS 7 or higher
  recommended). If you install Apache and you want improved performances, you can
  enable its mod_perl module.</dd>
