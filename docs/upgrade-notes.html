<h1>Notes for Upgraders</h1>
                                            
<p>This is a consolidated list of release note items relevant to those
upgrading Bugzilla. If you are upgrading from version X.X to version Y.Y,
you need to read all the notes for every version between them, plus those
for version Y.Y.</p>

<p>Each new version of Bugzilla has many enhancements and improvements.
Issues are listed here only if they might lead to an admin needing to pay
special attention and possibly take manual steps to update their installation,
its extensions, or code which interacts with their Bugzilla. So the focus
is on backwardly-incompatible changes. This is not a complete list of changes.</p>

<p>If, when upgrading, you hit an issue which is not documented here and which
was not caused by your own changes or customizations, please file a bug to get
it added to this document.</p>

<h2>4.4</h2>

<h3>Apache Configuration Change</h3>

<p>
  For improved security, Bugzilla now prevents directory browsing
  by default. In order to do that, the root <kbd>bugzilla/.htaccess</kbd> file
  now contains the <kbd>Options -Indexes</kbd> directive. By default, this
  directive is not allowed in <kbd>.htaccess</kbd> and so you must configure
  Apache to allow it. To do that, add <kbd>Options</kbd> to the
  <kbd>AllowOverride</kbd> directive in <kbd>httpd.conf</kbd>. This means you
  should now have something like this:
  <p>
    <kbd>AllowOverride Limit FileInfo Indexes Options</kbd>
  </p>
  Check the
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.4/en/html/configuration.html#http-apache">documentation</a>
  for more information about how to configure Apache.
</p>

<h3 id="v44_code_changes">Code Changes Which May Affect Customizations and Extensions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <em>usebugaliases</em> parameter has been removed. Aliases are now
    always available.</li>
  <li>It is now illegal to have a product with no components and no versions.
    Trying to delete the last component or version of a product is now
    rejected.</li>
  <li>Trying to set the component, target milestone or version of a bug
    to a disabled value is no longer accepted. The change will be rejected.</li>
  <li>Quips can no longer exceed 512 characters. Existing quips longer than
    that are automatically truncated when upgrading.</li>
  <li>The static <kbd>bugzilla.dtd</kbd> file has been replaced by a dynamic
    one to take custom fields into account. The old
    <em>&lt;urlbase&gt;/bugzilla.dtd</em> URL is now
    <em>&lt;urlbase&gt;/page.cgi?id=bugzilla.dtd</em>.</li>
  <li>There is a new extension located at <kbd>extensions/MoreBugUrl/</kbd>
    which permits to add new classes of URLs in the See Also field. It uses
    the <kbd>bug_url_sub_classes</kbd> hook mentioned above.</li>
  <li>In the RDF output of <kbd>config.cgi</kbd>, URIs used to identify
    versions and target milestones have been changed to be unique across
    products.</li>
  <li>The RDF output of <kbd>config.cgi</kbd> now also returns data about
    classifications.</li>
  <li>Rows in the <kbd>dependencies</kbd>, <kbd>flaginclusions</kbd> and
    <kbd>flagexclusions</kbd> DB tables are now enforced to be unique.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>bugs_activity</kbd> and <kbd>profiles_activity</kbd> DB
    tables now have an auto-incremented primary key named <kbd>id</kbd>.</li>
  <li>A custom <kbd>Bugzilla.pm</kbd> module has been added into
    <kbd>contrib/</kbd> to help packagers to package Bugzilla in their
    Linux distros.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v44_ws_changes">Notable WebService Changes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <kbd>User.login</kbd> WebService method now also returns a
    <kbd>token</kbd> argument containing a login token which you can use in
    subsequent calls to authenticate. For security reasons, this method
    no longer generates login cookies.
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=893195">Bug 893195</a>)</li>
  <li>The <kbd>User.get</kbd> WebService method now correctly takes the
    <kbd>maxusermatches</kbd> parameter into account when the <kbd>match</kbd>
    argument is passed. Previously, it was returning all matching accounts.
    To further limit the number of accounts returned by <kbd>User.get</kbd>,
    you can now pass the <kbd>limit</kbd> argument.
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=962060">Bug 962060</a>)</li>
  <li><kbd>Bug.add_attachment</kbd> now only returns the ID of the newly
    created attachments instead of all the attachment data.</li>
  <li><kbd>Bug.comments</kbd> now also returns <kbd>creation_time</kbd>
    which is exactly the same as <kbd>time</kbd>, but is provided for
    consistency with <kbd>Bug.get</kbd> and <kbd>Bug.attachments</kbd>.
    The <kbd>time</kbd> field may be deprecated and removed in a future release,
    so you should use <kbd>creation_time</kbd> instead.</li>
  <li>Field names returned in the <kbd>field_name</kbd> field of the
    <kbd>Bug.history</kbd> method have changed to be consistent with other
    methods.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>Bug.search</kbd> method was returning all visible bugs
    when called with no arguments, ignoring the <kbd>max_search_results</kbd>
    and <kbd>search_allow_no_criteria</kbd> parameters. This has been fixed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.2</h2>

<h3 id="v42_code_changes">Code Changes Which May Affect Customizations and Extensions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <kbd>email/newchangedmail.txt.tmpl</kbd> template is now fully templatized,
    meaning that the diff table displaying changes in bug fields is
    now generated in the template itself. This means bugmails are now
    fully localizable.</li>
  <li>The bugmail_recipients hook has been modified to pass <kbd>diffs</kbd> with
    changes made to the bug as well as <kbd>users</kbd> including
    recipients of the email notification.</li>
  <li>YUI has been upgraded to 2.9.0.</li>
  <li>Due to the major code refactor of <kbd>Bugzilla/Search.pm</kbd>, any
    customization made against this file will probably need to be rewritten.</li>
  <li>The Bugzilla-specific <kbd>url_quote</kbd> filter used in templates
    has been removed and replaced by the <kbd>uri</kbd> filter from Template::Toolkit
    as they are now similar.</li>
  <li><kbd>long_list.cgi</kbd>, <kbd>showattachment.cgi</kbd> and <kbd>xml.cgi</kbd>
    have been removed from the codebase. As <a href="#v40_code_changes">announced</a>
    in the release notes of Bugzilla 4.0, these scripts were deprecated
    since Bugzilla 2.19.</li>
  <li><kbd>sidebar.cgi</kbd> has been removed, because Gecko-based browsers no
    longer support remote XUL, and its popularity is very low.</li>
  <li><kbd>contrib/yp_nomail.sh</kbd> has been removed. This script is no longer
    useful since Bugzilla 3.0.</li>
  <li><kbd>contrib/bugzilla_ldapsync.rb</kbd> has been removed. This script didn't
    work for a long time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v42_ws_changes">Notable WebService Changes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In <kbd>Bug.fields</kbd>, the <kbd>sortkey</kbd> attribute used in
    <kbd>values</kbd> has been renamed to <kbd>sort_key</kbd>.</li>
  <li>In <kbd>Bug.attachments</kbd> and <kbd>Bug.add_attachment</kbd>,
    the <kbd>is_url</kbd> attribute no longer exists.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.0</h2>

<h3>Apache Configuration Changes</h3>

<h4>mod_cgi</h4>

<p>If you run Bugzilla under mod_cgi (this is the most common
  configuration, involving a &lt;Directory&gt; block in your Apache config
  file), you will need to update the configuration of Apache for 
  Bugzilla. In particular, this line in the Bugzilla
  <kbd>&lt;Directory&gt;</kbd> block:</p>

<blockquote><code>AllowOverride Limit</code></blockquote>

<p>needs to become:</p>

<blockquote><code>AllowOverride Limit FileInfo Indexes</code></blockquote>
 
<p>For full details on how to configure Apache for Bugzilla,
  see the
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.4/en/html/configuration.html#http-apache">Configuration</a>
  section of the Bugzilla Guide.</p>

<h4>mod_perl</h4>

<p>If your Bugzilla runs under mod_perl, the required Apache
  configuration is now simpler. The line that used to look like:</p>

<blockquote><code>PerlSwitches -w -T -I/var/www/html/bugzilla 
    -I/var/www/html/bugzilla/lib</code></blockquote>

<p>Now should be only:</p>

<blockquote><code>PerlSwitches -w -T</code></blockquote>

<p>The <code>PerlConfigRequire</code> line should stay the same, however.</p>

<h3>New .htaccess file</h3>

<p>In previous versions of Bugzilla, there was a file
  in Bugzilla's root directory called ".htaccess" that was
  generated by <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd>. This file is now shipped with
  Bugzilla instead of being generated during installation.</p>

<p>If you update via CVS, bzr or git, you will get a message that your existing
  .htaccess file conflicts with the new one. You must
  <strong>remove your existing .htaccess file</strong> and use the new one
  instead. Continuing to use your old .htaccess file will cause certain new
  features of Bugzilla to not work properly, and may also lead
  to security issues for your system in the future.</p>

<h3 id="v40_code_changes">Code Changes Which May Affect Customizations and Extensions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In Extensions, if you want to serve files to the user via the web,
    they must now be in a <kbd>web/</kbd> subdirectory of your Extension.
    (For example, <kbd>extensions/Foo/web/</kbd>). <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd>
    sets permissions on extensions much more strictly now, and files in
    other locations (such as your base <kbd>extensions/Foo/</kbd> directory)
    will no longer be available to Bugzilla users via the web
    under certain configurations.</li>
  <li>Previous versions of Bugzilla used to allow putting a
    single file into the "skins" directory and having that be an entire
    skin. That is no longer allowed, and on upgrade, <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd>
    will convert any such skins into a directory with a single
    <kbd>global.css</kbd> file in them.</li>
  <li>When updating bugs, you should now use
    <code>$bug-&gt;set_all</code> instead of using the individual
    <kbd>set_</kbd> methods. In particular, <kbd>set_all</kbd> is now the
    <em>only</em> way to set the product of a bug. See
    <kbd>process_bug.cgi</kbd> for an example of how <kbd>set_all</kbd>
    should be used.</li>
  <li>You should not insert &lt;script&gt; tags and &lt;link&gt; CSS tags
    into HTML anymore, in Extensions or in your customizations. Instead,
    you should push new values into the <kbd>style_urls</kbd> or
    <kbd>javascript_urls</kbd> parameters. If you have to insert manual
    tags for some reason, be sure to call "FILTER mtime" on the URL. (Search
    for other uses of "FILTER mtime" in the templates to see how it is
    used.)</li>
  <li>When calling <kbd>Bugzilla::BugMail::Send</kbd>, the "changer"
    argument must now be a <kbd>Bugzilla::User</kbd> object, not just
    a login name. The "owner" and "qacontact" arguments are still
    just login names.</li>
  <li>When creating a new subclass of Bugzilla::Object, you should no
    longer use <kbd>UPDATE_VALIDATORS</kbd>. Also, in most cases you will
    no longer need to override <kbd>run_create_validators</kbd>. Instead,
    there is a new constant called
    <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/4.4/en/html/api/Bugzilla/Object.html#VALIDATOR_DEPENDENCIES">VALIDATOR_DEPENDENCIES</a>,
    that specifies that certain fields have to be validated before other fields.
    Then, all validators receive each already-validated value in a hash
    as their fourth argument, so each validator can know the other values
    that were passed in, while an object is being created. For an example of
    how to use <kbd>VALIDATOR_DEPENDENCIES</kbd>, see
    <kbd>Bugzilla/Field.pm</kbd>.</li>
  <li>In previous versions of Bugzilla, you had to call
    <code>Bugzilla-&gt;template_inner("")</code> after any time
    that you called <kbd>template_inner</kbd> for a specific language.
    It is no longer necessary to do this second <kbd>template_inner</kbd>
    call.</li>
  <li><kbd>post_bug.cgi</kbd> and <kbd>Bugzilla::Bug-&gt;create</kbd> now take
    the <em>names</em> of groups instead of group ids.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla::Bugmail now uses Bugzilla::Bug objects internally instead of
    a lot of direct SQL.</li>
  <li>For sending changes about bugs, there is now a method
    called <kbd>send_changes</kbd> that you can call on Bugzilla::Bug
    objects. For an example of its use, see <kbd>process_bug.cgi</kbd>.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>Bugzilla::Search</kbd> class has been refactored, and should
    now be easier to customize.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>Bugzilla::Util::lsearch</kbd> function is gone. Use
    <kbd>firstidx</kbd> from <kbd>List::MoreUtils</kbd>, instead.</li>
  <li>Bugzilla now includes YUI 2.8.2.</li>
  <li><kbd>long_list.cgi</kbd>, <kbd>showattachment.cgi</kbd> and
    <kbd>xml.cgi</kbd> are deprecated scripts which are no longer actively
    used since Bugzilla 2.19. These scripts will be removed in
    Bugzilla 4.2.</li>
  <li>The system for moving bugs between installations has been
    moved into an extension called <kbd>OldBugMove</kbd>. This system was used
    by very few Bugzilla installations--if you aren't certain
    whether or not you are using it, you're not using it. To enable the system,
    you have to remove the file <kbd>extensions/OldBugMove/disabled</kbd>
    and then run <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd>. In a future version of Bugzilla,
    this extension may be moved outside of the core Bugzilla code,
    so if you are interested in maintaining it, please let us know.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v40_ws_changes">Notable WebService Changes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <kbd>Bug.create</kbd> WebService method now throws an error if you
    pass a group name which doesn't exist. In Bugzilla 4.0 and 4.0.1,
    this group name was silently ignored, leaving your bug unsecure
    if no other group applied.
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=653341">Bug 653341</a>)</li>
  <li>WebServices methods will return undefined bug fields as undefined
    instead of as an empty string. This change is consistent with how
    Bugzilla 4.2 behaves.
    (<a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=657561">Bug 657561</a>)</li>
  <li>The <kbd>Bug.get</kbd> function now returns all of a bug's
    information other than comments and attachments.</li>
  <li><kbd>Bug.get</kbd> no longer returns the <kbd>internals</kbd> hash.</li>
  <li>The following functions now support the <kbd>include_fields</kbd>
    and <kbd>exclude_fields</kbd> arguments: <kbd>Bug.get</kbd>,
    <kbd>Bug.search</kbd>, and <kbd>Bug.attachments</kbd>. Also,
    server-side performance of the WebService is actually increased when
    using these arguments, now, as Bugzilla will no longer
    get data from the database for fields you haven't asked for.</li>
  <li>You can no longer search using the <kbd>votes</kbd> argument in
    <kbd>Bug.search</kbd>.</li>
  <li><kbd>Bug.attachments</kbd> now returns the attachment's description
    using the name "summary" instead of the name "description", to be
    consistent with the fact that bug summaries are called
    "summary". The value is still <em>also</em> returned as "description",
    for backwards compatibility, but this backwards compatibility will go
    away in Bugzilla 5.0.</li>
  <li>In the return values of various <kbd>Bug</kbd> functions, the author
    of comments, bugs, and attachments is now called "creator",
    instead of sometimes being called "reporter", "author", or "attacher".
    The old names are retained for backwards-compatibility, and will stay
    around until Bugzilla 5.0.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.6</h2>

<h3 id="v36_upgrading">DB Consistency Check</h3>

<p>When upgrading to 3.6, <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> will create foreign keys
  for many columns in the database. Before doing this, it will check the
  database for consistency. If there are an unresolvable consistency
  problems, it will tell you what table and column in the database contain
  the bad values, and which values are bad. If you don't know what else to do,
  you can always delete the database records which contain the bad values by
  logging in to your database and running the following command:</p>

<p><code>DELETE FROM <var>table</var> WHERE <var>column</var> IN 
  (<var>1, 2, 3, 4</var>)</code></p>

<p>Just replace "table" and "column" with the name of the table 
  and column that <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> mentions, and "1, 2, 3, 4"
  with the invalid values that <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> prints out.</p>

<p>Remember that you should always back up your database before doing
  an upgrade.</p>

<h3 id="v36_code_changes">Code Changes Which May Affect Customizations and Extensions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>There is no longer a SendBugMail method in the templates, and bugmail
    is no longer sent by processing a template. Instead, it is sent
    by using <kbd>Bugzilla::BugMail::Send</kbd>.</li>
  <li>Comments are now represented as a
    <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.6/en/html/api/Bugzilla/Comment.html">Bugzilla::Comment</a>
    object instead of just being hashes.</li>
  <li>In previous versions of Bugzilla, the template for displaying
    a bug required a lot of extra variables that are now global
    template variables instead.</li>
  <li>You can now check if optional modules are installed by using
    <kbd>Bugzilla-&gt;feature</kbd> in Perl code or
    <kbd>feature_enabled</kbd> in template code.</li>
  <li>All of the various template header information required to display
    the bug form is now in one template,
    <kbd>template/en/default/bug/show-header.html.tmpl</kbd>.</li>
  <li>You should now use <kbd>display_value</kbd> instead of
    <kbd>get_status</kbd> or <kbd>get_resolution</kbd> in templates.
    <kbd>display_value</kbd> should be used anywhere that a
    &lt;select&gt;-type field has its values displayed.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v36_ws_changes">Notable WebService Changes</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The WebService now returns all dates and times in the UTC timezone.
    <kbd>Bugzilla.time</kbd> now acts as though the Bugzilla
    server were in the UTC timezone, always. If you want to write clients
    that are compatible across all Bugzilla versions,
    check the timezone from <kbd>Bugzilla.timezone</kbd> or
    <kbd>Bugzilla.time</kbd>, and always input times in that timezone
    and expect times to be returned in that format.</li>
  <li>In the <kbd>Bug.add_comment</kbd> method, the "private" parameter
    has been renamed to "is_private" (for consistency with other methods).
    You can still use "private", though, for backwards-compatibility.</li>
  <li>The WebService now has Perl's "taint mode" turned on. This means that
    it validates all data passed in before sending it to the database.
    Also, all parameter names are validated, and if you pass in a parameter
    whose name contains anything other than letters, numbers, or underscores,
    that parameter will be ignored. Mostly this just affects
    customizers--Bugzilla's WebService is not functionally
    affected by these changes.</li>
  <li>In previous versions of Bugzilla, error messages were
    sent word-wrapped to the client, from the WebService. Error messages
    are now sent as one unbroken line.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.4</h2>

<h3 id="v34_upgrading">DB Consistency Check</h3>

<p>When upgrading to 3.4, <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> will create foreign keys
  for many columns in the database. Before doing this, it will check the
  database for consistency. If there are an unresolvable consistency
  problems, it will tell you what table and column in the database contain
  the bad values, and which values are bad. If you don't know what else to do,
  you can always delete the database records which contain the bad values by
  logging in to your database and running the following command:</p>

<p><code>DELETE FROM <var>table</var> WHERE <var>column</var> IN 
  (<var>1, 2, 3, 4</var>)</code></p>

<p>Just replace "table" and "column" with the name of the table 
  and column that <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> mentions, and "1, 2, 3, 4"
  with the invalid values that <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> prints out.</p>

<p>Remember that you should always back up your database before doing
  an upgrade.</p>

<h3 id="v34_code_changes">Code Changes Which May Affect Customizations and Extensions</h3>

<ul>
  <li><kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> now re-writes the <kbd>localconfig</kbd>
    file every time it runs, keeping the current values set (if there
    are any), but moving any unexpected variables into a file called
    <kbd>localconfig.old</kbd>. If you want to continue having custom
    varibles in <kbd>localconfig</kbd>, you will have to add them to
    the <code>LOCALCONFIG_VARS</code> constant in 
    <kbd>Bugzilla::Install::Localconfig</kbd>.</li>
  <li><kbd>Bugzilla::Object-&gt;update()</kbd> now returns something different
    in list context than it does in scalar context.</li>
  <li><kbd>Bugzilla::Object-&gt;check()</kbd> now can take object
    ids in addition to names. Just pass in <code>{ id =&gt; $some_value
    }</code>.</li>
  <li>Instead of being defined in <kbd>buglist.cgi</kbd>, columns for
    search results are now defined in a subroutine called <code>COLUMNS</code>
    in <kbd>Bugzilla::Search</kbd>. The data now mostly comes from the
    <kbd>fielddefs</kbd> table in the database. Search.pm now takes a list
    of column names from fielddefs for its <kbd>fields</kbd> argument instead 
    of literal SQL columns.</li>
  <li><kbd>Bugzilla::Field-&gt;legal_values</kbd> now returns an array of
    <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/3.6/en/html/api/Bugzilla/Field/Choice.html">Bugzilla::Field::Choice</a>
    objects instead of an array of strings. Bugzilla::Field::Choice will be used
    in more places, in the future.</li>
  <li>We now use <kbd>Bugzilla::Bug-&gt;check()</kbd> instead of 
    <kbd>ValidateBugId</kbd>.</li>
  <li>The <kbd>groups</kbd> and <kbd>bless_groups</kbd> methods in 
    <kbd>Bugzilla::User</kbd> now return an arrayref of 
    <kbd>Bugzilla::Group</kbd> objects instead of a hashref with
    group ids and group names.</li>
  <li>Standard Bugzilla drop-down fields now have their type
    set to <kbd>FIELD_TYPE_SINGLE_SELECT</kbd> in the fielddefs table.</li>
  <li><kbd>Bugzilla-&gt;usage_mode</kbd> now defaults to 
    <kbd>USAGE_MODE_CMDLINE</kbd> if we are not running inside a web
    server.</li>
  <li>We no longer delete environment variables like <kbd>$ENV{PATH}</kbd>
    automatically unless we're actually running in taint mode.</li>
  <li>We are now using YUI 2.6.0.</li>
  <li>In <a href="config.cgi?ctype=rdf">the RDF format of config.cgi</a>,
    the "resource" attribute for flags now contains "flag.cgi" instead
    of "flags.cgi".</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="v34_ws_changes">Notable WebService Changes</h4>

<ul>
  <li><kbd>Bugzilla.timezone</kbd> is now deprecated.</li>
  <li>Many WebService function parameters now take individual values in
    addition to arrays.</li>
  <li>The WebService now validates input types--it makes sure that dates
    are in the right format, that ints are actually ints, etc. It will throw
    an error if you send it invalid data. It also accepts empty ints, doubles,
    and dateTimes, and translates them to <kbd>undef</kbd>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.2</h2>

<ul>
  <li>If you upgrade by CVS, the <kbd>extensions</kbd> and 
    <kbd>skins/contrib</kbd> directories are now in CVS instead of
    being created by <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> If you do a <kbd>cvs update</kbd>
    from 3.0, you will be told that your directories are "in the way" and
    you should delete (or move) them and then do <kbd>cvs update</kbd>
    again. Also, the <kbd>docs</kbd> directory has been restructured
    and after you <kbd>cvs update</kbd> you can delete the <kbd>docs/html</kbd>,
    <kbd>docs/pdf</kbd>, <kbd>docs/txt</kbd>, and <kbd>docs/xml</kbd>
    directories.</li>
  <li>If you are using MySQL, you should know that Bugzilla
    now uses InnoDB for all tables. <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd> will convert
    your tables automatically, but if you have InnoDB disabled,
    the upgrade will not be able to complete (and <kbd>checksetup.pl</kbd>
    will tell you so).</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="v32_code_changes">Code Changes Which May Affect Customizations</h3>

<ul>
    <li>You should now be using <code>get_status('NEW')</code> instead of
    <code>status_descs.NEW</code> in templates.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3.0</h2>

<h3 id="v30_code_changes">Code Changes Which May Affect Customizations</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The old <kbd>SendSQL</kbd> function and all of its companions are
  <strong>gone</strong>. Instead, we now use DBI for all database
  interaction. For more information about how to use 
  <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?DBI">DBI</a> with 
  Bugzilla, see the 
  <a href="https://www.bugzilla.org/docs/developer.html#sql-sendreceive">Developer's
  Guide Section About DBI</a>.</li>
