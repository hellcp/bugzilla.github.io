## Bugzilla Support Options

The options described here are for installation, administration, and
customization support for Bugzilla server software. If you are an
end-user of a Bugzilla, please consult the support options made
available by that Bugzilla's owner.

## Where to Ask Questions

  - **[mozilla.support.bugzilla](https://www.mozilla.org/about/forums/#support-bugzilla)** -
    This discussion forum is for Bugzilla users and administrators of
    Bugzilla sites to ask for help or share information. It is available
    as a mailing list, newsgroup and Google Group.
  - **[\#bugzilla](ircs://chat.freenode.net/bugzilla)** on freenode -
    Most of the Bugzilla developers are on this IRC channel. (although
    you may have to be patient to get our attention, since we aren't
    always watching the window).

## Private Emails Do Not Help Others

If you mail one of the Bugzilla developers directly with a support
question, you're likely to be ignored. This doesn't mean that we don't
want to help you out, on the contrary, we very much want to see you
succeed in using Bugzilla. It's just that we don't like answering the
same questions over and over again, and one-on-one support is pretty
difficult via email. Thus we provide our general support in a public
forum (the newsgroup and mailing lists mentioned above) where the
questions and answers get archived and can be used by future Bugzilla
admins at their leisure. This also allows other knowledgable Bugzilla
admins help us out in providing support. We'll also try to help out on
the IRC channel (see above) when possible (it's just easier that way).

## Commercial Support

Bugzilla is a community supported project. This means we don't directly
offer any commercial support, but rather provide the public forums
listed above where you can get assistance. If you're still looking for
commercial support for Bugzilla, however, you might try one of these
[consultants](consulting.html) who have offered their services.
