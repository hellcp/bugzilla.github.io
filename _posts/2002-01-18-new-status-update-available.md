It's been a while since our last status update. Unfortunately, because
it's been so long, this one is also rather lengthy. However, it does
contain the most recent information about Bugzilla's development as a
whole and the upcoming 2.16 release in particular. So, to find out
what's been happening in the Bugzilla world, take a gander at this
latest [status update](/news/2002/01/18/status-update).
