### 3.1.3

[Bugzilla 3.1.3](/releases/3.2/) has had massive changes: among those, a fresh new user interface for editing bugs and experimental support for Oracle databases (caution: read the [Status Update](/news/2008/02/01/status-update) before using Oracle with Bugzilla). This release should be considered unstable and only used in testing environments.
