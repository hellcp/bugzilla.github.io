title: Release of Bugzilla 2.23.2
---

Today we have a new development snapshot for you, Bugzilla 2.23.2. It has a lot of improvements and changes since 2.23.1, so we wanted to get it out and get it tested!

However, remember that this is a development release, and so it has **not been thoroughly tested**. You should only use it in a testing environment!

*   [Download Bugzilla 2.23.2](../download/#v224)
*   Read the latest [Status Update](../status/2006-07-09.html), which contains a description of what's new in this release.
